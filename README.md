## Overview:
Explain the purpose of this analysis.

## Results:
Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

### Deliverable 1 Requirements
You will earn a perfect score for Deliverable 1 by completing all requirements below:

* The following preprocessing steps have been performed:
* The EIN and NAME columns have been dropped (5 pt)
* The columns with more than 10 unique values have been grouped together (5 pt)
* The categorical variables have been encoded using one-hot encoding (5 pt)
* The preprocessed data is split into features and target arrays (5 pt)
* The preprocessed data is split into training and testing datasets (5 pt)
* The numerical values have been standardized using the StandardScaler() module (5 pt)

### Deliverable 2 Requirements
You will earn a perfect score for Deliverable 2 by completing all requirements below:

* The neural network model using Tensorflow Keras contains working code that performs the following steps:
* The number of layers, the number of neurons per layer, and activation function are defined (2.5 pt)
* An output layer with an activation function is created (2.5 pt)
* There is an output for the structure of the model (5 pt)
* There is an output of the modelâ€™s loss and accuracy (5 pt)
* The model's weights are saved every 5 epochs (2.5 pt)
* The results are saved to an HDF5 file (2.5 pt)

### Deliverable 3 Requirements
You will earn a perfect score for Deliverable 3 by completing all requirements below:

* The model is optimized, and the predictive accuracy is increased to over 75%, or there is working code that makes three attempts to increase model performance using the following steps:
* Noisy variables are removed from features (2.5 pt)
* Additional neurons are added to hidden layers (2.5 pt)
* Additional hidden layers are added (5 pt)
* The activation function of hidden layers or output layers is changed for optimization (5 pt)
* The model's weights are saved every 5 epochs (2.5 pt)
* The results are saved to an HDF5 file (2.5 pt)

* Data Preprocessing
  * What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
  * What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
  * What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
* Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
  * How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
  * Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
  * What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary:
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
